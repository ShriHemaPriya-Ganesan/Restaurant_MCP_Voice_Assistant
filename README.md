# üçΩÔ∏è Bon App√©tit - Restaurant AI Assistant

An interactive restaurant management assistant that brings together AI-powered conversations, live order updates, and kitchen coordination ‚Äî all through a modern web interface.

This project combines voice interaction, real-time order tracking, and AI intelligence to create a smoother experience for both customers and staff.

# ‚ú® Overview

The Restaurant AI Assistant lets customers speak naturally to place, customize, or cancel orders ‚Äî while kitchen and admin dashboards update live in real time.

During busy hours, instead of waiting for a server, guests can simply talk to the AI. The system understands the request, interacts with the backend through MCP tools, and keeps everything in sync across the kitchen and front desk.

# üß† How It Works

> Voice Interface ‚Äì Customers use a built-in voice assistant to order food, ask about ingredients, or make changes.

> AI Integration (OpenAI) ‚Äì GPT models interpret natural speech and decide which backend "tool" (function) to call ‚Äî such as creating, modifying, or canceling orders.

> Model Context Protocol (MCP) ‚Äì Bridges the AI and backend logic, enabling the model to run real functions like orders_create or orders_cancel.

> WebSocket Updates ‚Äì Kitchen dashboards receive instant order changes without refreshing.

> React Frontend ‚Äì Provides a clean, simple UI for Voice Assistant, Kitchen Display, and Admin panels.
