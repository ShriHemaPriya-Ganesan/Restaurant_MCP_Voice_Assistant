# üçΩÔ∏è Bon App√©tit - Restaurant AI Assistant

An interactive restaurant management assistant that brings together AI-powered conversations, live order updates, and kitchen coordination ‚Äî all through a modern web interface.

This project combines voice interaction, real-time order tracking, and AI intelligence to create a smoother experience for both customers and staff.

# ‚ú® Overview

The Restaurant AI Assistant lets customers speak naturally to place, customize, or cancel orders - while kitchen and admin dashboards update live in real time.

During busy hours, instead of waiting for a server, guests can simply talk to the AI. The system understands the request, interacts with the backend through MCP tools, and keeps everything in sync across the kitchen and front desk.
